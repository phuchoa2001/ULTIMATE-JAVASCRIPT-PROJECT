# Lazy Loading Images

## Description

Lazy Loading Images is a web optimization technique implemented as a JavaScript module that enhances website performance by deferring the loading of off-screen images. This approach significantly improves initial page load time, reduces bandwidth usage, and enhances the overall user experience, especially for content-heavy websites or those with limited network connectivity.

## Features

- **Intersection Observer API**: Utilizes modern browser capabilities for efficient detection of image visibility.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Includes a scroll-based fallback for browsers that don't support Intersection Observer.
- **Customizable Offset**: Adjustable threshold for preloading images before they enter the viewport.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for image loading failures.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements throttling to minimize performance impact during scroll events.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing web projects with minimal setup.

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers supporting Intersection Observer API
- Includes fallback support for older browsers

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Implements timer logic and interactivity.
- **HTML**: Structures the application's layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the application's appearance.
