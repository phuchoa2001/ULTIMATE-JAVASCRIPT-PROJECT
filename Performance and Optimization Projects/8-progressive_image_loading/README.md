# Progressive Image Loading

## Description

Progressive Image Loading is a feature that enhances website performance and user experience by loading images progressively. This approach significantly improves perceived load time, reduces initial page weight, and provides a smoother visual experience, especially for image-heavy websites or those accessed on slower network connections.

## Features

- **Low-Quality Image Placeholder (LQIP)**: Initially loads a small, blurred version of the image.
- **Smooth Transition**: Implements a smooth fade-in effect when transitioning from LQIP to full-resolution image.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate into existing web projects with minimal setup.
- **Dark Mode**: Supports switching between light and dark themes for improved readability in different lighting conditions.
- **Theme Customization**: Allows users to personalize the color scheme of the website.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Implements timer logic and interactivity.
- **HTML**: Structures the application's layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the application's appearance.
