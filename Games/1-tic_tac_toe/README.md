# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with X's and O's. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: The game supports two players taking turns to make their moves on the same device.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid cells to place their marks (X or O).
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins by getting three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Draw Detection**: If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time to start a new round.
