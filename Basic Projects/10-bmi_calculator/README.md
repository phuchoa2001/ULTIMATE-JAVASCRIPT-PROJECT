# BMI Calculator

## Description

BMI Calculator is a web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. It provides a quick and easy way to determine if a person's weight falls within a healthy range for their height. The application also categorizes the BMI result into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation**: Enter height and weight to calculate BMI.
- **BMI Category**: Displays the corresponding BMI category based on the calculated value.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.

## BMI Categories

The BMI Calculator uses the following BMI categories based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for adults:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
- Obese: BMI â‰¥ 30
